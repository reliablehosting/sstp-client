SSTP-CLIENT
------------------------------------------

Background:
SSTP is Microsofts Remote Access Solution (RAS) for PPP over SSL. It can be used
instead of PPTP or L2TP, and is only available with Windows Vista/7 connecting to
a Windows 2008 Server. For further information on SSTP check out wikipedia's 
article on Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Socket_Tunneling_Protocol


What is SSTP-CLIENT:
SSTP-CLIENT is an SSTP client for Linux. It can be used to establish a SSTP 
connection to a Windows 2008 Server. This software is similar commandline 
and configuration as the pptp-client software.


Features:
* Establish a SSTP connection to a remote Windows 2k8 server.
* Async PPP support (most distributions provide this).
* Similar command line handling as pptp-client for easy integration.
* IPv6 support
* Basic HTTP Proxy support
* Certficate handling and verification
* Client certificate authentincation with peer
* Support for client certificate keys on hardware tokens
* SSTP plugin integration with NetworkManager v0.9 (available as separate package)


SSTP-CLIENT on Ubuntu:
It's pretty simple to integrate sstp-client into the Ubuntu / Debian distribution
distribution. An example script is provided in support/peer-sstp-example.txt

- Specify your MSCHAP password in /etc/ppp/chap-secrets
  Example Entry:
     SSTP-TEST\\JonDoe  sstp-test   'testme1234!'    *
- Create a connect script in /etc/ppp/peers/sstp-test, similar to the example 
  provided in ./support. Swap out user-name as appropriate
- Start the script as: pon sstp-test


Future:
In the future we want to provide a SSTP server functionality as well. Code have
been refactored such that this goal can be accomplishable. Also check out the 
TODO file.


Help Wanted:
I need help with various features, please drop me an email if you have some
bandwidth to work on any of this. The TODO file should provide you with a
list of wanted features. 


Compiling:
To compile this on your favorite distribution make sure you have the development 
tools and headers available. This project depends on the PPP package, libevent and
OpenSSL.

For example:
  sudo apt-get install ppp-dev
  sudo apt-get install libevent-dev
  sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

 * MicroTik have a working server and client version in the router software (as of March 2010).

 * SSToPer is another SSTP client, but doesn't support Async HDLC frames
